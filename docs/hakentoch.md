6. Application Requirements: 
Please find the Application Requirements and Submission Requirements outlined below (hereinafter, referred to collectively as the “Requirements”).  

What to Create: 

Entrants must develop a NEW next-generation AI Agent that utilizes multimodal inputs and outputs. The project must move beyond simple text-in/text-out interactions. It should leverage Google’s Live API with the creative power of video/image generation to solve complex problems or create entirely new user experiences. All projects must leverage a Gemini model, agents must be built using Google GenAI SDK or Agent Development Kit, and projects must use at least one Google Cloud service. All use of Google developer tools, including input and outputs for this Contest must abide by the Google Cloud Acceptable Use Policy at https://cloud.google.com/terms/aup to meet the Requirements, and will be disqualified if they not not abide by the Acceptable Use Policy.

Projects must be built within one of these three categories: 

Live Agents 

Focus: Real-time Interaction (Audio/Vision).
Build an agent that users can talk to naturally can be interrupted. This could be a real-time translator, a vision-enabled customized tutor that "sees" your homework, or a customer support voice agent that handles interruptions gracefully.
Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini Live API or  the use of ADK. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
Creative Storyteller 

Focus: Multimodal Storytelling with Interleaved Output
Build an agent that thinks and creates like a creative director, seamlessly weaving together text, images, audio, and video in a single, fluid output stream. Leverage Gemini's native interleaved output to generate rich, mixed-media responses that combine narration with visuals, explanations with generated imagery, or storyboards with voiceover, all in one cohesive flow. Examples include Interactive storybooks (text + generated illustrations inline),  marketing asset generator (copy + visuals + video in one go), educational explainers (narration woven with diagrams), and social content creator (caption + image + hashtags together).
Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini's interleaved/mixed output capabilities. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
UI Navigator 

Focus: Visual UI Understanding & Interaction
Build an agent that becomes the user's hands on screen. The agent observes the browser or device display, interprets visual elements with or without relying on APIs or DOM access, and performs actions based on user intent. Examples include a universal web navigator, a cross-application workflow automator, or a visual QA testing agent.
Mandatory Tech: Must use Gemini multimodal to interpret screenshots/screen recordings and output executable actions. The agents are hosted on Google Cloud.
 

Project Team: You may submit your Project as an individual, a team, or on behalf of an organization. A Team must consist of only Eligible Individuals, have all team members added as members of the Project on Devpost. If a team or Organization is entering the Submission, one individual must be appointed and authorized (the “Representative”) to represent, act, and enter the Submission, on the team’s behalf.

New Projects Only: Projects must be newly created by the entrant during the Contest Period. The Project must be your original creation not a modification or extension of your or anyone else’s existing work.

Third-Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs, data and/or any information belonging to a third party, Entrants must be authorized to use these third-party tools and information in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool. If using third-party integrations/content/etc;, you must indicate it in your submission description with specificity

Testing: Access must be provided to an Entrant’s working Project (if available) for judging and testing by providing a link to a website, functioning demo, or a test build. If Entrant’s website is private, Entrant must include login credentials in its testing instructions. The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Judges are not required to test the Project and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission.

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third-party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.

Language: The Application must, at a minimum, support English language use. All Submission materials must be in English or, if not in English, the Entrant must provide an English translation of the demonstration video, text description, and testing instructions as well as all other materials submitted.

8. JUDGING:
On or about the period between March 17, 2026 through April 3, 2026, (“Judging Period”) the Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges in the following Stages. Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor.  

The Submissions will be evaluated by the Judges in the following Stages:

Stage One: The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the Submission meets a baseline level of viability, in that the Submission includes all Submission requirements, reasonably addresses a Challenge, and reasonably applies the requirements.

Stage Two: All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two by the Judges based on the following weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the Judges. Each Submission will receive a score from 1 to 5 per criterion and those criterion scores will be averaged per Submission.

Innovation & Multimodal User Experience (40%):
The "Beyond Text" Factor: Does the project break the "text box" paradigm? Is the interaction natural, immersive, and superior to a standard chat interface? Does the agent "See, Hear, and Speak" in a way that feels seamless?
Category Execution:
(For Live Agent Submissions): Does the agent handle interruptions (barge-in) naturally? Does it have a distinct persona/voice?
(For Storyteller Submissions): Is the media interleaved (text, image, and audio) seamlessly into a coherent narrative?
(For UI Navigator Submissions): Does the agent demonstrate visual precision (understanding screen context) rather than blind clicking?
Fluidity: Is the experience "Live" and context-aware, or does it feel disjointed and turn-based?
Technical Implementation & Agent Architecture (30%):
Google Cloud Native: Does the code effectively utilize the Google GenAI SDK or ADK? Is the backend robustly hosted on Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Vertex AI, Firestore)?
System Design: Is the agent logic sound? Does it handle errors, API timeouts, or edge cases gracefully?
Robustness: Does the agent avoid hallucinations? Is there evidence of grounding?
Demo & Presentation (30%):
The Story: Does the video clearly define the problem and the solution?
The Proof: Is the architecture diagram clear? Is there visual proof of Cloud deployment in the video or submission materials?
The "Live" Factor: Does the video show the actual software working (not just mockups)?
Subcategory Prize Determination: All eligible entries will be used to determine the winners for the subcategory prizes. The scores recorded for each individual judging criterion will be used to determine the winner for the corresponding subcategory prize. In accordance with the eligibility rules, if a project qualifies for both a primary Category prize and a subcategory prize, the subcategory prize will be awarded to the next highest-scoring project.
