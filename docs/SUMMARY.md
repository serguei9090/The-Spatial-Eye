# The Spatial Eye - Project Summary

## The Problem
Users face three critical barriers when interacting with the physical world through AI:
1. **Troubleshooting Overload**: In complex environments like car engines or server racks, following purely verbal instructions is time-consuming and prone to error—users need to *see* exactly what to touch, not just hear about it.
2. **Disconnected Creativity**: Bringing real-world objects into a child's imagination is difficult without immediate visual and narrative synthesis.
3. **Static Technical Design**: IT specialists often lose momentum when project ideas can't be translated from verbal concepts into structured architectural diagrams in real-time.

## The Solution
**The Spatial Eye** solves these challenges using the **Gemini 2.5 Live API** to create a high-fidelity cognitive link to reality:
- **Visual Spatial Highlighting**: Instead of cryptic verbal cues, the AI "circles" or highlights components (like a specific car part) directly on the live video feed, guiding the user with surgical precision.
- **Multimodal Storytelling**: It transforms mundane objects into vivid, interleaved stories for children, using live images to anchor digital narratives in the real world.
- **Live Architecture Synthesis**: It acts as a real-time technical partner for IT specialists, listening to project ideas and instantaneously generating interactive diagrams that evolve as the conversation progresses.
